<h1 id="title">My Projects</h1>

<p class="text col-lg-7 grow">
  In the span of 2 years i have had the opportunity to work on some projects which helped me get introduced to some diff 
  platforms as well as new programming languages. Some of which i am currently woking on.
</p>

<h1 id="title">Recent Projects</h1>

<div class="heads">Automatic lights control</div>

  <p class="text col-lg-7 grow float" >
    This was the first project that got me involved with arduino and its sensors. In this project i used 2 pir sensors which were used
    to detect a person and also to identify the direction of movement of the person so that it can decided whether the person is entering
    or leaving. And if the number of persons was more than 1 the lights would remain on. The same data was sent to blynk servers from where 
    the user could look at the active time and number of persons.

  <div class="col-lg-12">
  <div class="heads">Robotic Arm</div>
  <img src="./images/robo.jpg" class="img-fluid imageL float" alt="Responsive image" >
  <p class="text col-lg-10 grow" >
    This was for a workshop organized by the institute in this the first 2 projects were for the basic operations of the robotic arm
    while the third one was upto us to design a functionality for the arm. In this our team decide to make a tic tak toe playing robot
    In this the user entered there move and the robotic arm decides its optimal move and then the arm moved to that place on the 
    board to place its cap on the said place. In this project i learned about the motor shield and library and also about taking input from 
    pc and sending to arduino.
  </p>

  <div class="heads extra" >Laser Turret</div>

  <p class="text col-lg-7 grow float" >
    I saw video about making a laser turret with servos and controlling it with mouse and i implemented the same. IN that program i used
    visual studio and c# to take coordinates of mouse inside the window and then those were sent to arduino which then sent the same to servos
    and the servos moved accordingly.

  <div class="col-lg-12">
    <div class="heads">Rescue</div>
    <img src="./images/rescue.jpg" class="img-fluid imageL float extras" alt="Responsive image" >
    <p class="text col-lg-10 grow" >
      This was a project which we made for our submission in SIH. In this we made a system in which the location of the phone were sent to 
      our own server hosted on a raspberry pi. The proposed system could be used to detect persons who are lost and do not have internet connectivty
      The raspberry pi was mounted to drone which then goes over the loaction and retrieves data. And this data can be used by the Rescue
      team for detecting the location. In this i learned about programming and using raspberry pi and 
      interfacing it with sensors. Also in this project i used php and html to create get requests so that the phone sent the get request 
      and the data from request was stored on database and google maps api were used to display the coordinates on website for the rescue team

  <div class="heads extra" >Chrome Dino Automator</div>
  

  <p class="text col-lg-7 grow float" >
    In this i automated the dino game in crome. Using the python libraries for keypress as well as image detection. I used pillow library
    tp detect the obstacle and then the key was pressed. The obstacle was detected and based on its height the dinosaur jumped or ducked
    and i handled the transition to dark mode by taking a refrence point which made sure that the obstacle is different from background
    and i also handled the increasing speed of the movement

  <div class="heads">Discord Bot</div>
  
    <p class="text col-lg-7 grow float" >
      I made a discord bot which can play songs as weel as skip,stop,pause songs. In this i implemented queue so that users can add songs to 
      queue while the current song is being played. For this i used the youtube api which gave the videos link from its name 
      and using this link a strea was created using ytdl library and i also added the ablility to randomly playing songs
      in which it serached the youtube trending and added a random song to queue. Currently improving its capabilities and Some
      exception handling.

    <div class="heads">Library Management</div>
    <img src="./images/lib.jpg" class="img-fluid imageL float" alt="Responsive image" >
    <p class="text col-lg-10 grow" >
      In this ia am currently creating a database using python and creating the Required pl/sql blocks as well as functions and procedures
      and then i will try to create the frontend for same so that a full software can be prepared where a librarian can issue books
      and the user can view there details and issue or return books and calculate their fine.
    </p>
  </div>
  
    <div class="heads extra" >Smart Charger</div>
  
    <p class="text col-lg-7 grow float" >
      In this i am trying to create an app which runs in background and when the battery its reaching its capacity sends a request to 
      the node mcu and then the node mcu triggers the relay board which controls the charger as it will change the state of
      charger from on to off and if the battery falls below some specified level it again starts charging so that the battery remains 
      at optimal level
